-- targilim:
1. create a function called printBiggest with the following overloading:
   printBiggest() -- will print "I am the biggest of them all!"
   printBiggest(int a) -- will print a + " is biggest"
   printBiggest(int a, int b) -- will print the biggest of a and b + " is biggest"
   printBiggest(int a, int b, int c) -- will print the biggest of a and b and c+ " is biggest"
2. create a function that accepts Scanner as an argument and inputs a float from the user
   hint: inputFromUser(Scanner s)
3. create a function that accepts Random as an argument and prints a random number and also gets the min max range as parameters
   hint: createRandom(Random r, int min, in max)
4. create a function that accepts an array of double, and also min max range as parameters
   hint: printInRange(double[] arr, double min, double max)
   the function will print all the array elements which are in the range
   for example: 
   arr = { 0.5, 0.7, 5, -2, 12.5 }
   min = -4
   max = 0.5
   will print: 0.5, -2 
   ** etgar: create a double[] array which will hold the number of elements in the range
   for example: 
   arr = { 0.5, 0.7, 5, -2, 12.5 }
   min = -4
   max = 0.5
   result = { 0.5, -2 } --> the result array should be in size 2 since only two numbers were in range!!
